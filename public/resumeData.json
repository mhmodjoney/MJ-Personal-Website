Born in a small town of 'lattakia, syria' I am moving to UAE where I will be looking for work as a full stack developer , alongside my many ongoing projects. I love to create and tend to keep a few too many projects on the go at a time. Outside of work I am an soccer player and content creator. I love to travel and lead a fairly nomadic lifestyle. I built much of my early portfolio from mountain of slenfia,lattakia and dream of being able to take my work with me while travelling the world.",
